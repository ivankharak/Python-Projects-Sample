# Take Screenshot Using PyhtonðŸ”¥

## ðŸ“ŒIntroduction

- Screenshot, also known as screen capture, is a digital image that shows the contents of a computer display. A common screenshot is created by the operating system or software running on the device. Taking, saving, and sharing screenshots can be extremely helpful.

## ðŸ“ŒSteps to Take a Screenshot using Python

- **ðŸ‘‰Step 1: Install the pyautogui package**

To start, youâ€™ll need to install the [pyautogui](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package using the following command (under Windows):

    pip install pyautogui
    
**ðŸ”¸What is PyAutoGUI**

PyAutoGUI lets your Python scripts control the mouse and keyboard to automate interactions with other applications.

**âœ¨Features**

**(a)** Moving the mouse and clicking or typing in the windows of other applications.

**(b)** Sending keystrokes to applications (for example, to fill out forms).

**(c)** Take screenshots, and given an image (for example, of a button or checkbox), find it on the screen.

**(d)** Locate an applicationâ€™s window, and move, resize, maximize, minimize, or close it (Windows-only, currently)

**(e)** Display message boxes for user interaction while your GUI automation script runs.


- **ðŸ‘‰Step 2: Capture the path to save the screenshot**

Next, capture the full path where the screenshot will be saved on your computer.

In my case, I decided to save the screenshot under the following path:

    C:\Users\KISHAN\Desktop\screenshot1.png

Here, the file name is screenshot1, while the file type is png (alternatively, you can set the file type to jpg).

- **ðŸ‘‰Step 3: Take the screenshot using Python**

For the final step, youâ€™ll need to use the template below in order to take the screenshot using Python:

    import pyautogui
    
    myscreenshot = pyautogui.screenshot()
    
    myscreenshot.save("Enter your location")

Now, when you run the code the screenshot will automatically save at your provided location with the name of you provided in the code.

Thatâ€™s it! simple, isnâ€™t it?
