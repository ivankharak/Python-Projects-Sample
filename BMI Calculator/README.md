## ðŸ“ŒWhat is Body Mass Index (BMI)?

- BMI is a measure of relative weight based on an individualâ€™s mass and height. Today, Body Mass Index is commonly used to classify people as underweight, overweight, and even with obesity. Also, it is adopted by countries to promote healthy eating.

- BMI can be considered as an alternative for direct measurements of body fat. Besides, BMI is an inexpensive and easy-to-perform method of screening for weight classes that may cause health problems.

## ðŸ“ŒBMI Calculator with Python

- The body mass index is calculated by dividing an individualâ€™s weight in kilograms by their height in meters, then dividing the answer again by their height. Now letâ€™s see how to create a BMI calculator with Python:

### Code:

    height = float(input("Enter your height in centimeters (cms) "))

    weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kg "))

    height = height / 100

    BMI = weight / (height ** 2)

    print("Your Body Mass Index is ",BMI)

    if BMI > 0:
        if BMI <= 16:
            print("You are severley underweight")

        elif BMI <= 18:
            print("You are underweight")

        elif BMI <= 25:
            print("You are Healthy")

        elif BMI <= 30:
            print("You are overweight")

        else:
            print("You are severley overweight")

    else:
        print("Please enter correct values") 
        
        
### Output:

    Enter your height in centimeters (cms) 170
    Enter your Weight in Kg 67
    Your Body Mass Index is 23.18339100346021
    You are Healthy
